# Predicting Diabetes Using Perceptron Algorithm

This project applies the **Perceptron learning algorithm** to predict diabetes diagnosis based on patient medical data. The notebook demonstrates the full workflow of preprocessing, training, and evaluating a linear classifier on healthcare data.

---

## ðŸ“Œ Project Overview
Diabetes prediction is a classic classification problem in machine learning. By using features such as glucose level, BMI, blood pressure, and age, we train a **Perceptron model** to classify whether a patient is likely diabetic or not.

## âœ¨ Features
- Data preprocessing and cleaning  
- Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
- Implementation of the **Perceptron algorithm**  
- Comparison with Scikit-learnâ€™s `Perceptron`  
- Model evaluation using classification metrics and visualization
